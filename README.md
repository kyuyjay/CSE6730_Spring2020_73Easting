# CSE6730 Modeling and Simulation Spring 2020 Project 2
## Battle of 73 Easting
This project takes the form of a tutorial that guides the participant through the evolution of combat models, evaluating the effectiveness and pitfalls of each approach.

### Continuous Time Model
Based on Lanchester's Laws, the model only takes into account force composition and effectiveness

### Markov Chain Model
The addition of a longer kill chain adds an element of stochastism

### Agent Based Model
A full model that takes advantage of the self-organizing and self-emergent behavior of individual actors to produce realistic results. Accounts for terrain factors as well as a heterogeneous mix of agent types.
